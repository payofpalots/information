As a first step, we strongly recommend that customers initiate direct communication with the merchant to resolve issues pertaining to a specific order. If you do not get a satisfactory response or no response you can then raise a chargeback with your bank as a second option. These chargebacks will be raised with Razorpay by your bank and we assist to amicably resolve the issue.<br><br>Note:<br><br>Generally buyers must wait at least 7 days from the date of payment to escalate a dispute for an item not received with their bank. Where an item has not been received, please ensure you have given the seller enough time before opening a dispute</p> <div class="feedback"><div class="feedback-option feedback-option-negative"><i class="icon icon-wrong"></i>
